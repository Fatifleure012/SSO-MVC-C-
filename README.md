What is Single Sign On (SSO)?
To access any secured page in a web application, the user needs to authenticate and if the user want to access multiple web applications then the user have to login for each of those application individually. Logging in multiple times can be eliminated with Single Sign On i.e. user has to login only once and can access web multiple applications.
here we implement sso using MVC application 4 programmed with C#
